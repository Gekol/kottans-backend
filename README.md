## Git Basics

I have watched the Udacity Git Course and it was awesome!!! I've already had experience with Git but it was great to have an opportunity to learn some new commands.

## Unix Shell

I have passed the Linux Survival Course and I had many things to learn there. The knowledge I got will be necessary for me in the future so I'm glad to have got it.

## Git Collaboration

I have watched the Udacity Git Collaboration Course. It was more difficult than I thought. However, now I know how to use Git and GitHub for teamwork. That knowledge is essential for any IT specialist so it's excellent I have it!!!

## Memory Management
What's going to happen if program reaches maximum limit of stack?
Answer: there will be stack overflow error and the program will receive Segmentation Fault. But if the stack is dynamic we will be able to access to an unmapped memory region.

What's going to happen if program requests a big (more then 128KB) memory allocation on heap?
Answer: the heap will be enlarged via the brk() system call (implementation) to make room for the requested block.

What's the difference between Text and Data memory segments?
Answer: Data Segment stores the contents for static variables initialized in source code. The text segment is read-only and stores all of your code in addition to tidbits like string literals.
