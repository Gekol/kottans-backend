## Git Basics

I have watched the Udacity Git Course and it was awesome!!! I've already had experience with Git but it was great to have an opportunity to learn some new commands.

## Unix Shell

I have passed the Linux Survival Course and I had many things to learn there. The knowledge I got will be necessary for me in the future so I'm glad to have got it.

## Git Collaboration

I have watched the Udacity Git Collaboration Course. It was more difficult than I thought. However, now I know how to use Git and GitHub for teamwork. That knowledge is essential for any IT specialist so it's excellent I have it!!!
